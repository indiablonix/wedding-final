      <p>Our story is so bizarre that it's almost unbelievable...</p>
      <p>It was in the summer of 2015. My brother, Josh, and I played A LOT of Destiny on XBox at that time. Well, one night Josh was playing by himself when he saw someone on the enemy team with my gamertag. At least, he thought it was mine. The next day, he told me that he met a girl with a gamertag almost indentical to mine the night before and that I should look her up. He told me how he thought it was me until he realized she was a female Hunter and he knew I played a male Titan. That's when he noticed the difference in our names. My gamertag is WalkerOfTheSky (because of Star Wars, duh!). And Karla's gamertag is Walker0fthesky, with a zero instead of the letter O. Crazy, huh? So, of course, I thought that was pretty frickin cool and I decided to message Karla that night to tell her that my brother played with her the night before and that I thought her gamertag was awesome! We started playing together more and more until there wasn't a day that went by that we didn't talk to each other. Whenever I saw her gamertag pop up to let me know that she was online, I got extremely excited! She was, and still is, the highlight of my every day. We became very close. We loved each other's company. We had the same interests and hobbies. (Star Wars and video games, obviously :-P) Somehow it took us about a year to figure out that we both wanted to be more than just friends. I asked her to be my girlfriend on July 7, 2016, which happens to be Bungie Day. (Bungie is the game developer that created Destiny and, for whatever reason, that company is completely obesessed with the number 7, so July 7th is Bungie Day) In December of that same year, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the love of my life in person for the first time! That was my first time on an airplane! It was kind of a big deal...and definitely worth it! :-D We had an amazing week! We went to Disney Land and Universal Studios! We watched Rogue One: A Star Wars Story at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood! I had the time of my life! I never wanted it to end. I didn't want to go home without her...</p>
      <p>Well, Karla, her mom, and her brother were going to find a new place to live soon, so I suggested that she could move to Tennessee and be with me if she wanted. And guess what! She said yes! I could barely believe it! So two months later in February 2017, I flew back to California so I could meet her mother, Enriqueta, her brother, Ariel, and her close friend, Ray-Lynn. Then I drove back to Tennessee with my soul mate! It was a long journey! And we got to see the Grand Canyon on our way! You have to see it in person to understand how truly beautiful it is! :)</p>
      <p>On December 22, 2017, Karla and I flew back to California to visit her family and friends for the holidays. Little did she know, I had some other plans of my own. I decided that I wanted to marry this beautiful creative funny intelligent amazing woman the first time I saw her at the Los Angeles Airport, so it only seemed fitting that should be the place that I ask her to marry me. Ray-Lynn and Alison, another one of Karla's close friends, were going to pick us up from the airport. The first time that I met Ray-Lynn, I promised her that I would involve her in my proposal, if it ever happened. Once I decided that I was going to propose to Karla at the airport, I made good on my promise. I messaged Ray-Lynn to let her know the plan and asked if she would be kind enough to take pictures/video of the proposal. Of course, she was happy to do it! :)</p>
      <p>And as they say...the rest is history! <3</p>
